# **Ionvale - Repurpoused Designer Clothing**

# **Website Overview**
Welcome to the foundation of what is to be Ionvale's website and e-commerce platform. Ionvale is a startup clothing brand I am building. Although the scope of this project is to show competiencies in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, this website will later be built out to have e-commerce capabilites as my development skills progress with the course. In the context of this assignment this webiste aims to represent the initial stage of the business. I hope for the user to get a small sense of the brand and have them subscribe so that we can notify them when the Ionvale brand is trading.

# **User Experience (UX)**
+ ## **User Journey**
    + **Instagram Re-directed visitors**
        1. I want to gain a basic understanding of what the brand Ionvale does.
        2. I want  to meet the team, learning basic information about the founders, their mission and their qualifications.
        3. I want the user to recognise the handmade nature of Ionvales products from the home landing image.
        4. I want to easily follow Ionvales other social media platforms
        5. I want to sign up to more news from Ionvale on their launch.

           In the context of the development stage of the business, this user persona is what the website is built for. Our social media content creation begins in the coming weeks. From this we hope to drive traffic to this website. The ultimate goal is to give them a further insight into what we do and to have them sign up to be notified of our first stock launch.
+ ## **Design**
    + **Color Scheme**
      + When deciding on the colour scheme of website I used my gained knowlege of both marketing and web development to draw the conclusion that a basic colour scheme was best suited to the website. 
      1. **Nav Bar & Footer**: For my nav bar and footer I used a basic light grey background. This was to avoid any major color or theme clashes throughout the website. The light grey added a level of depth without affecting the visibility of my nav bar options.

      2. **Main Body**: For the main body of the website I used a white background to ensure that the content being delivered was as legible as possible. Similiar to the grey navbar, white allowed for less theme clashes and helped draw attention to my main landing image. 

      3. **Social Icons**: For the social media Icons I decided on a blue color. My rational for this is that my submit button on my sign-up form was also blue. My hope was that users would recognise another opportunity to click on an item for more interaction with Ionvale's brand. Further to this Facebooks brand color is blue and market research shows users think blue when they think of social media platforms.

    + **Typography**  

      + When decising on the typography I wanted for my website, I drew learnings from my advertising and marketing modules from my time in University College Cork. Here I researched the effectiveness of different font types in delivering a message to a consumer/user. I wanted to use a font that was similiar to 'Helvetica' but I also felt this lacked some personality. I decided to settle on **'Roboto'** which is very similiar to 'Helvetica'. **'Sans-serif'** was set as my backup font.
 
    + **Imagery**
    
      + **Home Section Image**: Deciding on my home section image was quintessential to the user experience in my website. I wanted it to highlight to the user that the nature of our business was handmade clothing. It was important to me that the bespoke designer element of the business was the first scene set for the user. 
      + **Meet the Team Section Images**: The images used in the 'Meet the Team' section of the website were all selected due to their common theme. It was important that they were relatively uniform and didn't distract too much from the other important content around them.

    + **Mockups**

      + To create my wireframes I purchased a premium subcription on [Moqups](https://moqups.com/). I initially started with sketches and then decided to design my Wireframes with UX in mind.

      1. [**Bootstrap 4.5.3:**](https://getbootstrap.com/)
